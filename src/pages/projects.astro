        Since high school, I created lots of projects to let myself learn new
        web technologies ... from browser Web APIs, and libraries, to
        frameworks. Most of the projects are open-sourced on <a
          href="https://github.com/rayriffy">my GitHub</a
        >, if you like what you see then consider following and maybe support me
        through sponsors as well.
